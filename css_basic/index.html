            <h1>Chelsea Football Club</h1>
            <p>
                Chelsea Football Club is one of the most successful football clubs in the world, and today, we are going

            </p>

            <h2>Creation</h2>

            <p>
                There was already a team named Fulham FC, so a few names were suggested before the adoption of Chelsea
                FC as the club's name. These included:
            </p>

            </ul>
